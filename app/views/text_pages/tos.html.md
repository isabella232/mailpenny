### Terms and Conditions of Service

Last updated: April 7, 2016.

This Terms and Conditions of Service Agreement (“Agreement”) is a binding agreement between you (“End User” or “you”) and Payload Technologies, Inc. (“Company”, “we” or “us”). This Agreement governs your use of this website, themailman.io (the “Website”).

BY REGISTERING AND/OR LOGGING IN, YOU (A) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS AGREEMENT; (B) REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE OF LEGAL AGE TO ENTER INTO A BINDING AGREEMENT; AND (C) ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE LEGALLY BOUND BY ITS TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT REGISTER, LOG-IN, AND/OR USE THE WEBSITE.

1.  **Description of Website.**  
    The Website provides a platform for enabling direct communication, interaction and engagement between (a) individuals from whom it may otherwise be difficult to elicit a response (each, a “Target Responder”) and (b) individuals who wish to initiate messages to a Target Responder and receive a response (each, an “Initiator”). An Initiator uses the Website to send a message (each, a “Message”), the notification of which is sent via email or phone text message, to Target Responder.  
    Target Responder will be rewarded upon a successfully completed messaging transaction in which Target Responder provides a response to Initiator within 48 hours, or an otherwise specified length of the time that is designated in writing in the initial notification, after Initiator sends the Message (each, a “Transaction”). Each Target Responder will have an Account and the ability to choose and set the fee amount that an Initiator must pay (the “Initiator Fee”) for Target Responder to respond by email or phone text.

2.  **Payment by Initiators.**  
    Initiators may pay for Messages via debit cards, credit cards, AliPay, Bitcoin, or any other payment methods that Company may approve in the future. Company will use third-party payment processing companies, such as Stripe and Plaid, to collect and distribute payments for Company’s services. For more details about how we use and store payment and other personal user information, please see our Privacy Policy, linked to and incorporated into this Agreement by reference.  
    All purchases are final and no refunds will be provided; however, if an Initiator pays for a Message and does not receive a response from Target Responder, the money will be credited to the Initiator’s account with Company (the “Account”) and can be used to pay for Messages to other
    Target Responders.

3.  **Payment to Target Responder.**  
    Each Target Responder must set up an Account and select an Initiator Fee. After each completed Transaction, Company will deposit the Initiator Fee into Target Responder’s Account. When the balance in Target Responder’s Account reaches at least $30.00, Target Responder may request that Company withdraw the funds from the Account and transfer such funds to Target Responder; provided, however, that Target Responder must provide to Company appropriate payment and personal information for the transfer. Company may transfer the funds by AliPay, Bitcoin transfer, or check in Company’s sole discretion.  
    Each Target Responder agrees that Target Responder is solely responsible for any expenses incurred with respect to Transactions. Target Responder shall have full responsibility for applicable taxes for all funds paid to Target Responder under this Agreement.

4.  **Target Responder Charity Donations.**  
    Company will provide Target Responder with the option to donate all money in Target Responder’s Account to a United States 501(c)(3) organization of Target Responder’s choice. You may indicate on your Company profile whether you have pledged the money in your Account to charity. The funds will be donated after the balance in Target Responder’s Account reaches at least $30.00.

5.  **Service Fees.**  
    Company will charge a fifty percent (50%) service fee for each completed Transaction before a withdrawal and transfer of earned Initiator Fees to Target Responder. However, if Target Responder selects the option to donate to charity pursuant to Section 4 above, Company will charge a twenty percent (20%) service fee for each completed Transaction before a withdrawal and transfer of Initiator Fees to the selected United States 501(c)(3) organization.

6.  **Disputed Transactions.**  
    If an Initiator is dissatisfied with a Transaction, Initiator may contact Company at info@payload.tech. In such cases, Company will review the Transaction and decide, in its sole discretion, whether the Initiator’s dispute of the Transaction is valid. If Company determines that the Initiator’s dispute of the Transaction is valid, Company will credit to the Initiator’s Account the Initiator Fee paid for the Transaction. Target Responder agrees that Target Responder may not be rewarded for responses that the Company determines, in its sole discretion, are invalid, such as automatic replies. You agree that your only recourse in the event of a disagreement with Company’s decision regarding the validity of a response is to terminate your relationship with Company.

7.  **Registration Information.**  
    To access and use the Website, each Initiator and Target Responder must register for an account by providing your full legal name, current address, phone number, a valid email address, and any other information indicated as required. You agree to provide accurate information upon registration and agree not to misrepresent yourself or impersonate someone other than yourself. Company may reject your application for an Account, or cancel an existing Account, for any reason, in our sole discretion. You are responsible for keeping your password secure.

WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, COMPANY SPECIFICALLY DOES NOT REPRESENT THAT ANY TARGET RESPONDER COMMUNICATIONS OR CONTENT WILL MEET THE EXPECTATIONS OF ANY INITIATOR.  
    SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF OR LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATIONS ON THE APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

19. **Limitation of Liability.**  
    TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL COMPANY OR ITS AFFILIATES, OR ANY OF ITS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE LICENSORS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS, HAVE ANY LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE WEBSITE OR THE CONTENT AND SERVICES FOR:

Furthermore, you agree that Company assumes no responsibility for the content you submit or make available through this Website.

21. **Resolving Disputes.**  
    Customer service is a priority, but if there’s an issue that needs to be resolved, this section outlines what is expected of both of us.  

    1.  **Initial Informal Dispute Resolution.**  
        Before filing a claim against the Company, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting us via email at info@payload.tech. We will try to resolve the dispute by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days of submission, you or the Company may bring a formal proceeding.

    2.  **Arbitration Agreement.**  
        You and the Company agree to resolve any claims relating to this Agreement, whether or not such claims involve a third party, through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with the Company.

    3.  **Arbitration Notification.**  
        If either of us intends to seek arbitration under this agreement, the party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the dispute in writing at least thirty (30) days in advance of initiating the arbitration. Notice to the Company should be sent to us via email to info@payload.tech, with a duplicate copy sent via registered mail, return receipt requested, to the mailing address specified on our website. The notice must describe the nature and basis of the claim and the relief being sought.

    4.  **Arbitration Procedures.**  
        You may bring claims only on your own behalf. The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The arbitration will be held in San Francisco California, or any other location we agree to.  In the event that the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one (1) year of filing the case, then either the Company or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services.  Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies, or awards that conflict with these Terms.

    5.  **Arbitration Fees.**  
        The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.

    6.  **Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate.**  
        Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above. You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate, but to opt out, you must notify the Company in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must provide notice to us via email to info@payload.tech, with a duplicate copy sent via registered mail, return receipt requested, to the mailing address specified on our website. You must include your name and address, the primary contact and account administrator’s name and address, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A JURY TRIAL. You and the Company unconditionally waive any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim arising out of or relating to this agreement in any way.

    7.  **Prohibition of Class Arbitrations.**  
        YOU MAY ONLY RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH US ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND MAY NOT BRING A CLAIM AS A PLAINTIFF OR A CLASS MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed. This agreement does not allow class or collective arbitrations even if the AAA procedures or rules would allow them. Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, the arbitrator shall not have the power to determine that class arbitration is permissible. The arbitrator also shall not have the power to preside over class or collective arbitration, or to award any form of class-wide or collective remedy. If for any reason the prohibition of class arbitrations set forth above cannot be enforced, then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply.

    8.  **Judicial Forum for Disputes.**  
        IN THE EVENT THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IS FOUND NOT TO APPLY TO YOU OR YOUR CLAIM, YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE MUST BE LITIGATED EXCLUSIVELY IN THE FEDERAL OR STATE COURTS OF SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA. BOTH YOU AND THE COMPANY CONSENT TO VENUE AND PERSONAL JURISDICTION THERE.

22. **Force Majeure.**  
    Company will not be liable for any delay, interruption or failure in the provisioning of services if caused by acts of God, declared or undeclared war, fire, flood, storm, slide, earthquake, power failure, the inability to obtain equipment, supplies or other facilities that are not caused by a failure to pay, labor disputes, or other similar events beyond our control that may prevent or delay service provisioning.

23. **Severability.**  
    If any provision of this Agreement is illegal or unenforceable under applicable law, the remainder of the provision will be amended to achieve as closely as possible the effect of the original term and all other provisions of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect.

24. **Governing Law.**  
    This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule. Any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Website shall be instituted exclusively in the federal courts of the United States or the courts of the State of California in each case located in the County of San Francisco. You waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and to venue in such courts.

25. **Limitation of Time to File Claims.**  
    ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE WEBSITE MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES, OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

26. **Entire Agreement.**  
    This Agreement and our Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement between you and Company with respect to the Website and supersede all prior or contemporaneous understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, with respect to the Website.

27. **Waiver.**  
    No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, on the part of either party, any right or any power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or power hereunder preclude further exercise of that or any other right hereunder. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and any applicable purchase or other terms, the terms of this Agreement shall govern.
